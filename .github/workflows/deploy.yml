on:
  # We want it to run every time you push new code...

    # ...but only when the push is to your "main" branch.

    # It will run on a standard virtual machine provided by GitHub.

      # Step 2: Replace the Firebase Config placeholder with your secret
      # This step safely injects the Firebase config from GitHub Secrets.
      # It uses an environment variable (FIREBASE_CONFIG) to avoid issues
      # with special characters in the secret breaking the command.
      # The 'sed' command uses a pipe '|' as a delimiter, which is a robust
      # way to prevent conflicts with characters inside the JSON config string.
